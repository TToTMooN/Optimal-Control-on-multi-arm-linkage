# Optimal-Control-on-multi-arm-linkage

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to test how optimal control methods can work in nonlinear systems.

## Arm linkage system modelling

### Single arm system

To start with, we first start with a single arm system. The physics for this is simple, but this is a simple way to test if the controller is working.

### Two-arm system

Things becomes more difficult when more arms are introduced. The equation of motion is complex since centrifugal and Coriolis force are playing an important role. We will introduce a general way to generate the eom in later section. But now, we are using Lagrangian mechanics to solve this system.

### General method of for multi-arm system

We will use projected Newton Euler Equation to solve for eom of multi-arm system.

### Optimal Control Design
